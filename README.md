# SysBot.ACNHFishing

Overfishing is killing our oceans. Have a bot do it for you in a video game instead.

# How to use
1. Install [sys-botbase](https://github.com/olliz0r/sys-botbase/releases) to your cfw switch running [atmosphere.](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere/releases/tag/1.1.1)
2. Turn on ACNH, be willing to lose your inventory (back it up if need be), and run anywhere on your southern shore.
3. Turn on the bot so it creates a blank config.json, open that file and enter a [discord token](https://github.com/kwsch/SysBot.NET/wiki/Discord-Integration#setup) and logging channel so everything can get permanently logged to a channel.
4. Turn on the bot again. You character will start catching fish.

Enjoy.
