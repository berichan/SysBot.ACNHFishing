# SysBot.ACNHFishing

Overfishing is killing our oceans. Have a bot do it for you in a video game instead.

# How to use
1. Install [sys-botbase](https://github.com/olliz0r/sys-botbase/releases) to your cfw switch running [atmosphere.](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere/releases/tag/1.1.1)
2. Turn on ACNH, be willing to lose your inventory (back it up if need be), move your inventory cursor to the first slot, and run anywhere on your southern shore, ensure your inventory is now closed.
3. Turn on the bot so it creates a blank config.json, open that file and enter a [discord token](https://github.com/kwsch/SysBot.NET/wiki/Discord-Integration#setup) and logging channel so everything you catch can get permanently logged to a channel.
4. Turn on the bot again. You character will start catching fish.

Enjoy.
